## ✨ Key Features

### 📅 Semantic Timeline
Explore your memories on a dynamic, zoomable timeline. The app automatically clusters photos into "Events" based on time and visual similarity, creating a cohesive story of your life.

### 👤 Identity Discovery
Advanced face recognition (DETR + CLIP) identifies individuals across your entire library. Group photos by person, name your friends, and find every moment you shared with them.

### 📍 Global Map Mode
See where your memories were made. Photos with GPS metadata are pinned to an interactive world map, allowing you to re-travel your favorite journeys.

### 🔍 Intelligent Search
- **Keyword Search**: Find photos by date, location, or automatically identified tags.
- **Semantic Search**: Search for visual concepts (e.g., "sunset at the beach" or "birthday party") even if those words aren't in the filename.

### 🎨 Futuristic Interface
Experience a premium, glassmorphic UI with:
- **Sidebar-driven navigation** for a focused workspace.
- **Floating Island** controls for a minimalist aesthetic.
- **Micro-animations** and smooth transitions.
